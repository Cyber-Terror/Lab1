Put my trust in you my love
I defended you
Despite our past
I still breathe for you (for you)
My side is chosen for destiny
And this is all I see

Leaves falling down
Falling side by side
All I predicted has now begun
Leaves falling down
Anywhere I hide
All that was laid down
It seems I drown

You made my beliefs grow a little stronger
I'm at the end
Can't feel it no longer (longer)
